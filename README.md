This is the backend application for the website. 

This tutorial is pretty great for learning Django in general
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/

This one is pretty great for learning Heroku 
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-django

The general procedure to get things running is probably:
1. Install Heroku toolbelt

2. Clone this repository into some directory

3. Make your changes and push back, it will automatically be deployed

To run locally, you need to:
1. call "heroku run manage.py syncdb"

2. call "heroku local"

Hit me up on Slack if it doesn't work, which it probably won't
